# XMLCheck Assignment Manager
XMLCheck is a web application used in the course XML Technologies at Charles University in Prague and Czech Technical University in Prague. It allows students to submit source code in XML, XPath, XQuery, XSLT, XSD and Java, evaluates it for correctness and for similarity against submissions of other students.

The project was initially created by Jan Konopasek in the year 2011, I took over the project in 2014 to fix bugs and add additional functionality such as plagiarism checking.

This is a public version of the repository. It does not contain commit history and has student data removed.

You may read more about the project in my Bachelor's thesis (in Czech) that is stored in this repository as thesis.pdf.
